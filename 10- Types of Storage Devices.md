# Types of Storage Devices

## 1. Introduction
- Storage devices are crucial components in computers for data storage
- They provide one of the core functions of modern computers

## 2. Types of Storage

There are four main types of storage:

1. Primary Storage
2. Secondary Storage
3. Tertiary Storage
4. Off-line Storage

### 2.1 Primary Storage

Also known as main memory, directly or indirectly connected to the CPU via a memory bus.

**Examples:**
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- ROM (Read-Only Memory)
- Cache

#### 2.1.1 RAM (Random Access Memory)

Two types of RAM:
- DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
- SRAM (Static RAM)

| Feature | SRAM | DRAM |
|---------|------|------|
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Cost | More expensive | Less expensive |
| Power consumption | Higher | Lower |
| Refresh needed | No | Yes (thousands of times per second) |

#### 2.1.2 ROM (Read-Only Memory)

- Used during computer boot-up
- Contains firmware (small programs) for basic hardware operations
- Cannot be easily overwritten or modified

#### 2.1.3 Cache

- High-speed access area
- Can be a reserved section of main memory or a separate storage device
- Modern computers typically have L3 and L2 cache, older ones had only L1 cache

### 2.2 Secondary Storage

Not directly accessible by the CPU, requires I/O channels to access data.

**Example:** Hard Disk Drive (HDD)

#### Hard Disk Drive Features:
- Capacity: 160 GB to 2+ TB
- Rotation speed: 4500 to 7200 RPM
- Access time: measured in milliseconds
- Uses magnetic medium with iron particles
- Formatted into tracks and sectors

 |   Platters  |
 |   (disks)   |
 |             |
 |  Read/Write |
 |    Heads    |
  \___________/
```

### 2.3 Tertiary Storage

Involves robotic mechanisms for mounting and dismounting removable mass storage media.

**Examples:**
- Magnetic Tape
- Optical Discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray)

#### Optical Disc Comparison:

| Feature | CD | DVD | Blu-ray |
|---------|----|----|---------|
| Capacity | 700 MB | 4.7 - 17 GB | 50 GB |
| Laser wavelength | 780 nm | 650 nm | 405 nm |
| Read/Write speed | 1200 KB/s | 10.5 MB/s | 36 MB/s |

### 2.4 Off-line Storage

Also known as disconnected storage, requires human intervention to access data.

**Examples:**
- Floppy Disk (mostly obsolete, up to 1.44 MB)
- Zip Diskette (100-250 MB, less popular now)
- USB Flash Drive (2 GB to 256+ GB)
- Memory Cards (used in cameras, phones, etc.)

## 3. Storage Device Features to Consider

When choosing a storage device, consider:
1. Capacity
2. Speed (read/write)
3. Portability
4. Cost
5. Durability
6. Power consumption
7. Compatibility

## 4. Modern Trends in Storage

- Solid-state drives (SSDs) are becoming more common, offering faster speeds than traditional HDDs
- Cloud storage is increasingly popular for both personal and business use
- Increasing capacities in smaller form factors
- Improved energy efficiency in storage devices

## 5. Practice Questions

1. What are the four main types of storage?
2. Compare and contrast SRAM and DRAM.
3. Explain the basic principle of how data is stored on a hard disk drive.
4. What are the advantages of optical discs over magnetic storage?
5. Why is off-line storage still relevant in the age of cloud computing?

Remember to review these notes regularly and supplement them with hands-on experience with different storage devices when possible.
